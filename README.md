# Text Mining: Mid-Term Project

Sentiment Analysis with Rotten Tomatoes

Your goal is to build a classifier for classifying movie ratings contained in critics.csv into "fresh" and "rotten". You can (and are encouraged to) use the notebook week 4 naive bayes.ipynb as a foundation for your classifier.

You are expected to explore three different changes to the basic naive bayes classifier:
  1. Different preprocessing steps
  2. Different hyperparameters for naive bayes OR a completely different classification algorithm
  3. Including N-grams or sentiment into the classifier (both of these are covered in week 5)

For each of these, do not feel like you need to be exhaustive - do not go through every possible variation of preprocessing you can, but focus on one or two (e.g. including and excluding stop words and stemming).

After each change, re-evaluate the classifier to see if your additions have improved the performance or not.

You will not be evaluated based on the performance of your classifier. Rather, you will be primarily evaluated based on whether you have successfully implemented some of the content we've covered in the course and can successfully explain the methods you used and why you have taken the steps you have. Make sure to check the rubric to see how it will be graded.

You are expected to hand in:

Your code (in a .ipynb file), with comments explaining what you are doing
For each of the three changes you tried above, write a short explanation of what you did and why, a short explanation of the effect it had on performance, and a short summary of your thoughts of why the change you made had the effect that it did. Assume the reader has little understanding of text processing methods, so explain your methods in a way that explains what the method does and why it might help a classifier. You should write about two paragraphs (~5 sentences) per change. It's not necessary to write an introduction or conclusion. You can hand these in either as markdown text in the .ipynb with your code, or as a separate word document.
